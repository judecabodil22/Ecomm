                    <p>Ilocos collectively refers to two provinces in the Philippines: Ilocos Norte and Ilocos Sur which used to be a single province. Inhabitants are called Ilocanos and they speak the language Iloko, also called Ilocano.
                    <br>
                    The Ilocos Region, containing four provinces, is named after Ilocos. 56 percent of the inhabitants of the region are Pangasinan people, who belong to a different ethnolinguistic group from the Ilocanos. Ilocos may also refer to the former province before Ilocos Norte and Ilocos Sur were divided<br>
                    In the 330 pages “The Ilocos Heritage” (the 27th book written by Visitacion de la Torre), the boy legacy and the life of the Ilocano – are described as - "the browbeaten, industrious, cheerful, simple soul who has shown a remarkable strain of bravery and a bit of wanderlust." The Ilocano history reveals his struggles and victories – in battles for colonial independence from Spain and America, to Philippine leadership. The new Ilocano searched for greener pastures towards new lands local and foreign - Palawan, Mindanao, Hawaii, the United States and Greece. The Ilocano material culture and spirituality can be seen in the past - images of Spanish santo (saints), antique but intricate wooden furniture and quality local fiber. The native Ilocano is a weaver, wood carver and pottery expert. The Ilocano cuisine – ranges from the exotic "abu-os" (ant eggs) to vegetable broth "dinengdeng," the sticky "tinubong" to the "poqui-poqui" (eggplant salad). Ilocandia is filled with colonial churches, the legacy of Spanish Catholicism</p>
