                    <p>Iloilo (Hiligaynon: Kapuoran sang Iloilo; Karay-a: Probinsiya kang Iloilo; Filipino: Lalawigan ng Iloilo) is a province located in the region of Western Visayas in the Philippines. Iloilo occupies a major southeast portion of the island of Panay and is bordered by the province of Antique to the west, Capiz to the north, the Jintotolo Channel to the northeast, the Guimaras Strait to the east, and the Iloilo Strait and Panay Gulf to the southwest. Just off Iloilo's southeast coast is the island province of Guimaras, once part of Iloilo but now an independent province. Across the Panay Gulf and Guimaras Strait is Negros Occidental, occupying the northwestern half of the larger island of Negros.
                    <br><br>
Iloilo's capital is Iloilo City, though the city itself is independent and not governed by the provincial government of Iloilo. According to the 2015 census, the population of the province (excluding Iloilo City) is 1,936,423. If Iloilo City is included, the population is 2,361,042.</p>
